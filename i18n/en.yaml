      As an engineer, I seek to use technology to make sure that all soldiers return 
      home to their families. I believe that technology can help transition our society to become more ethical, 
      advanced, and humane. So far my professional experiences have spanned from air and space to cyberspace. I am
      cosntantly focused on improving myself and learning new technologies.
    </p>
